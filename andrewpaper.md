</div> </p> 

<br>

<p>The interconnection of billions of devices and the ever growing size of Internet-connected devices allowed a wide surface of entry points for cyber attacks. In the age of Big Data and the Internet of Things, data collection volumes are constantly increasing, with some systems absorbing up to a petabyte of security events each day, and ingestion rates are only expected to rise exponentially over time. As the sophistication, volume, and variety of cyber threats grows, so does the need for a strong, data-driven, real-time cyber security defensive plan. RL (Reinforcement Learning) is a popular paradigm for sequential decision making under uncertainty. A typical RL algorithm operates with only limited knowledge of the environment and with limited feedback on the quality of the decisions. To operate effectively in complex environments, learning agents require the ability to form useful abstractions, that is, the ability to selectively ignore irrelevant details. In the world of cybersecurity RL has proved to be one of the significant method to encounter cyber attacks, further in this paper we will discuss about how RL is using Big data to provide data security along with some different models.  </p>

### 1. Introduction 
<br>
<p>Reinforcement learning(RL) is a well-known method for making consecutive decisions in the face of uncertainty. The best example of Reinforcement learning is Cyber Security; all machine learning models work with data, and the amount of data collected by various software and hardware components all come into play. Big data combined with machine learning software allows businesses to detect and respond to intrusions in real-time. In this paper, we will further discuss how Big data is used in Reinforcement Learning to enhance data security. In the first section, we will get an understanding of Data Security, Reinforcement Learning and Big Data analytics in Cybersecurity. Whereas in the second section we will discuss the role of Big Data in cybersecurity, followed by how Big Data analytics help in cybersecurity. Furthermore, in the last section, we will discuss about the application of Reinforcement Learning and Big Data together and also look at the Intrusion detection system which uses the deep reinforcement learning method.  </p>

#### 1.1 Data Security 

<br>

<p>In recent decades, Data Security has been regarded as an important subject; with the vast volume of data travelled, there is a risk of data misuse and data breaching, making Data Security essential. This raised the demand for data security, allowing numerous approaches to provide data security, including Reinforcement Learning, a prominent method for improving data security. However, reinforcement learning is insufficient on its own; it must meet certain requirements before being deployed; here is where big data interacts with machine learning to increase data security.</p>

<br>


#### 1.2 Reinforcement Learning 

<br>

<p>Reinforcement learning is not a type of neural network, nor is it an alternative to neural networks. Rather, it is an orthogonal approach for Learning Machine. Reinforcement learning emphasizes learning feedback that evaluates the learner&#39;s performance without providing standards of correctness in the form of behavioral targets. Example: Dog Training.</p>

</p>

<br>

<p>The literal meaning of the word ‘reinforce’ is ‘to strengthen’. Reinforcement in psychology is to establish or encourage a pattern of behavior by providing a stimulus that can increase the probability of the desired behavior. <br>  Reinforcement is of 2 types: <br>
  Positive reinforcement — is to increase the probability of a positive response by giving a motivating stimulus after the desired behavior is presented.<br>
  Negative reinforcement — correcting an undesired behavior by providing an appropriate stimulus to reduce the probability of a negative (undesired) response.
</p>

<br>

#### 1.3 Big Data Analytics in Cyber Defense

<br>

<p>Big Data analytics elevates corporate security and company protection by using machine learning models, statics, predictive models, and computational systems that aid in identifying possible risks and improving proactive threat detection and response. By evaluating data from events preceding the attack, big data aids in the discovery of attack patterns and the discovery of relevant insights that will strengthen the cyber security system. However, its actual strength stems from its use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect irregularities instantaneously and automatically generate new security models based on continually changing attack behaviour. Machine Learning models assist in fast responding to an attack by automatically adjusting security settings based on the kind of assault learnt from prior experience. Big Data analytics plays an important part here; with the increasing number of cyber threats, it is critical to identify the danger, which Big Data analytics performs with simplicity. For example, a company which has never experienced any cyberattack can still use the Big Data analytics to ensure safety based on the history of attacks and insights.</p>

<br>

### 2. Role of Big Data in Cybersecurity
<br>
<p> As we discussed earlier the Big Data Analytics in cyber defence, lets get a better understanding of how Big Data Analytics implement different models and techniques which aid Data Security. </p>

#### 2.1 Predective Models and Big Data Analytics 

<br>

<p> We all understand the value of predictive models; in the case of cyber defence, the model attempts to identify the threat ahead of time so that countermeasures can be taken before the actual attack happens. Predictive models and Big Data analytics are not new; they have been used in Fraud Detection and Intrusion Detection for a long time. Traditionally, they were only used on structured data, and data usage was limited; however, with advances in machine learning, predictive models can now deploy large amounts of data and analyze them in real-time. Let's have a look at some of the benefits of Big Data Analytics in the context of cybersecurity: <br> </p> 

* It can store a vast quantity of data without any relational database management limits, and these can be used in real-time machine learning models rather than keeping them on an external disk, which takes a long time and requires a lot of space. 
* The amount of processing involved in decision making is not limited since they are expected to be intrusive the overhead time is minimized.
* Traditional strategies focused on high TPS and short response time, which compelled models to deploy regularly, delaying detection; however, with the help of Big Data tools, we were able to quickly overcome these issues.

<br>

#### 2.2 Automation and Cyber Resilience 

<br>

<p>Big Data allows to effectively improve the cyber resilience of a mission or service. Cyber resilience is one of the most significant factors; it simply allows firms to continue delivering the intended outcome despite any cyber attack. Within a automated model after the data is received, the system model must analyze the results, look for trends, determine the type of attack, and make a judgment. To make these kinds of decisions, the model must be trained about its decisions and responses through picking and taking responses, monitoring the impacts, and learning from these observations to improve performance over time.  </p>

##### The image displays the monitoring loop where data is collected from various IOT devices then data is analyzed to gain insights, insights are used for optimal response. The data is again collected from the sensors and the cycle keeps on looping, every time the data is generated the model learns better. 

<br>

### 3.Applying Big Data and Reinforcement Learning together
<br>

<p>Now as we have a comprehensive idea about how Big data plays a crucial role in Cybersecurity lets look at the advantages of RL over other models in Cybersecurity. Typically a supervised machine learning model applies a generic learning method, where the parameters are tuned to get an optimal result, this whole learning process revolves around labeled dataset, whereas RL works based on two components: an agent and environment. The agent observes the state of environment, as the environment encounters a situation the agent performs an action based on which a new state and a reward is generated, the purpose is to optimize maximum number of rewards. In RL there is no stored dataset of features with their associated labels, instead the framework learns through an intermediate function, and learning is not based on instantaneous information about best actions (feature samples and labels in a training dataset) but on a series of indications (rewards) on the value of intermediate actions with the ultimate goal of maximizing the total sum of rewards. The working of RL basically depends on the data every time data is used the model learns better, Moreover this whole process can be implemented in real time which makes RL an optimistic model for Cybersecurity. We will discuss some of the points why RL is considered over other models :-  </p>

* The neural network used for implementing classifier are simple and fast making them suitable for emerging network with high demands such as IOT.
* The reinforcement learning architecture is suitable for distrubuted high performance computing environments for example tenserflow, google cloud, MATLAB etc.
* The model allows simple parameter update in case of new data which allows real time learning. 
* The reward function which drives  detection can be extremely flexible and doesn’t need to be differentiable.

#### 3.1  Intrusion Detection System 


<p>Intrusion detection systems (IDS) is basically a technique where the network node and network are constantly tracked to flag any intrusions. IDS basically uses an anomaly-based technique or signature-based technique an algorithm that uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and active learning to efficiently learn and adapt to anomalies in real-world time series data. As I mentioned earlier Big data plays a huge role in signature-based technique." A user typically creates between 3 - 35 Megabytes of data in eight hours and it can take several hours to evaluate a single hour's worth of data," according to a research conducted by Frank for Intrusion Detection in 1994. Filtering, clustering, and feature selection on the data are also vital if real-time detection is sought, according to the researchers, which can boost detection accuracy. Big Data difficulties in intrusion detection existed long before the phrase "Big Data" was coined, as this case shows. Big Data approaches can help Intrusion Detection overcome the obstacles and costs that Big Data brings. This explains the importance of Big Data in Intrusion detection systems.  </p>

<br>

#### 3.1 Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

<br>

<p>As we have discussed about IDS, we will look at one of the popular approach that combines the Big Data and Reinforcement Learning for intrusion detection. The process starts with data sniffing where network traffic packets is collected, this is the part where big data plays an crucial role. Data usually contains some amount of discrepancies, Big data allows to collect all the information from networks, sensors and allows to send the information for data preprocessing where quality of data is controlled, data pre processing includes model training, the core of NIDS is reinforcement learning based anomaly detection enigine. Now big data and reinforcement learning works together, the model is designed in such a way that it learns automatically whenever new data is collected from network, the models learning depends on the amount of data being generated from network. As the amount of data increases the model achieves self-updating where model can self-learn the behavior of traffic.    </p>

</p>

##### This is the global architecture for security monitoring system, here we can observe the role of Big Data and ML together, the data is constantly being uploaded into the database and then the data is further analyzed where insights are extracted and used for intrusion detection.

<br>

<p>Intrusion detection systems may be upgraded with real-time data analytics, which will aid in the prevention of harmful acts on the systems. Businesses may now review prior data and real-time data to understand the behavior of what is typical data and avoid cyber assaults by merging BigData with machine learning. Many large companies are enhancing data security and this infrastructure allows a more subtle approach considered to other traditional methods. Machine Learning along with Big Data assured businesses from preventing cyber attacks, big data provided data management methods and threat detection however to upgrade this strategy reinforcement learning model played an important role.</p> 

### 4.Conclusion  

<br>

This clearly explains the potential of BigData, it is considered as the backbone for many fields, the same way it has been uplifting the cybersecurity field too.   </pr>
