<br>

<p>The interconnection of billions of devices and the ever growing size of Internet-connected devices allowed a wide surface of entry points for cyber attacks. In the age of Big Data and the Internet of Things, data collection volumes are constantly increasing, with some systems absorbing up to a petabyte of security events each day, and ingestion rates are only expected to rise exponentially over time. As the sophistication, volume, and variety of cyber threats grows, so does the need for a strong, data-driven, real-time cyber security defensive plan. RL (Reinforcement Learning) is a popular paradigm for sequential decision making under uncertainty. A typical RL algorithm operates with only limited knowledge of the environment and with limited feedback on the quality of the decisions. To operate effectively in complex environments, learning agents require the ability to form useful abstractions, that is, the ability to selectively ignore irrelevant details. In the world of cybersecurity RL has proved to be one of the significant method to encounter cyber attacks, further in this paper we will discuss about how RL is using Big data to provide data security along with some different models.  </p>

### 1. Introduction 
<br>
<p>Reinforcement learning(RL) is a well-known method for making consecutive decisions in the face of uncertainty. The best example of Reinforcement learning is Cyber Security; all machine learning models work with data, and the amount of data collected by various software and hardware components all come into play. Big data combined with machine learning software allows businesses to detect and respond to intrusions in real time. In this paper we will further discuss about how Big data is used in Reinforcement Learning to enhance data security. Furthermore, we will discuss about how big data aids in Data Security and how different intrusion detection system work on the basis of Reinforcemrent Learning and Big Data. </p>

#### 1.1 Data Security 

<br>

<p>In recent decades, Data Security has been regarded as an important subject; with the vast volume of data traveled, there is a risk of data misuse and data breaching, making Data Security essential. This raised the demand for data security, allowing numerous approaches to provide data security, including Reinforcement Learning, a prominent method for improving data security. However, reinforcement learning is insufficient on its own; it must meet certain requirements before being deployed; here is where big data interacts with machine learning to increase data security.</p>

<br>


#### 1.2 Reinforcement Learning 

<br>

<p>Reinforcement learning is not a type of neural network, nor is it an alternative to neural networks. Rather, it is an orthogonal approach for Learning Machine. Reinforcement learning emphasizes learning feedback that evaluates the learner&#39;s performance without providing standards of correctness in the form of behavioral targets. Example: Dog Training.</p>

<br>

<p>The literal meaning of the word ‘reinforce’ is ‘to strengthen’. Reinforcement in psychology is to establish or encourage a pattern of behavior by providing a stimulus that can increase the probability of the desired behavior. <br>  Reinforcement is of 2 types: <br>
  Positive reinforcement — is to increase the probability of a positive response by giving a motivating stimulus after the desired behavior is presented.<br>
  Negative reinforcement — correcting an undesired behavior by providing an appropriate stimulus to reduce the probability of a negative (undesired) response.

#### 1.3 Big Data Analytics in Cyber Defense

<br>

<p>Big Data analytics elevates corporate security and company protection by using machine learning models, statics, predictive models, and computational systems that aid in identifying possible risks and improving proactive threat detection and response. By evaluating data from events preceding the attack, big data aids in the discovery of attack patterns and the discovery of relevant insights that will strengthen the cyber security system. However, its actual strength stems from its use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect irregularities instantaneously and automatically generate new security models based on continually changing attack behavior. Machine Learning models assist in fast responding to an attack by automatically adjusting security settings based on the kind of assault learnt from prior experience. Big Data analytics plays an important part here; with the increasing number of cyber threats, it is critical to identify the danger, which Big Data analytics performs with simplicity. For example, a company which has never experienced any cyber attack can still use the Big Data analytics to ensure the safety based on the history of attacks and insights.   </p>

### 2. Role of Big Data in Cybersecurity
<br>
<p> As we discussed earlier about the Big Data Analytics in cyber defense, lets get a better understanding of how Big Data Analytics implement different models and techniques which aid Data Security. </p>

#### 2.1 Predective Models and Big Data Analytics 

<br>

<p> We all understand the value of predictive models; in the case of cyber defense, the model attempts to identify the threat ahead of time so that countermeasures can be taken before the actual attack happens. Predictive models and Big Data analytics are not new; they have been used in Fraud Detection and Intrusion Detection for a long time. Traditionally, they were only used on structured data, and data usage was limited; however, with advances in machine learning, predictive models can now deploy large amounts of data and analyze them in real time. Let's have a look at some of the benefits of Big Data Analytics in the context of cybersecurity: <br> </p> 

* It can store a vast quantity of data without any relational database management limits, and these can be used in real-time machine learning models rather than keeping them on an external disk, which takes a long time and requires a lot of space. 
* The amount of processing involved for decision making is not limited since they are expected to be intrusive the overhead time is minimized.
* Traditional strategies focused on high TPS and short response time, which compelled models to deploy on a regular basis, delaying detection; however, with the help of Big Data tools, we were able to quickly overcome these issues.

<br>

#### 2.2 Automation and Cyber Resilience 

<br>

<p>Big Data allows to effectively improve the cyber resilience of a mission or service. Cyber resilience is one of the most significant factors; it simply allows firms to continue delivering the intended outcome despite any cyber attack. After the data is received, the system model must analyze the results, look for trends, determine the type of attack, and make a judgment. To make these kinds of decisions, the model must be trained about its decisions and responses through picking and taking responses, monitoring the impacts, and learning from these observations to improve performance over time.  </p>
