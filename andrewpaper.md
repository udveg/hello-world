<br>

<p>The interconnection of billions of devices and the ever growing size of Internet-connected devices allowed a wide surface of entry points for cyber attacks. In the age of Big Data and the Internet of Things, data collection volumes are constantly increasing, with some systems absorbing up to a petabyte of security events each day, and ingestion rates are only expected to rise exponentially over time. As the sophistication, volume, and variety of cyber threats grows, so does the need for a strong, data-driven, real-time cyber security defensive plan. RL (Reinforcement Learning) is a popular paradigm for sequential decision making under uncertainty. A typical RL algorithm operates with only limited knowledge of the environment and with limited feedback on the quality of the decisions. To operate effectively in complex environments, learning agents require the ability to form useful abstractions, that is, the ability to selectively ignore irrelevant details. In the world of cybersecurity RL has proved to be one of the significant method to encounter cyber attacks, further in this paper we will discuss about how RL is using Big data to provide data security along with some different models.  </p>

### 1. Introduction 
<br>
<p>Reinforcement learning(RL) is a well-known method for making consecutive decisions in the face of uncertainty. The best example of Reinforcement learning is Cyber Security; all machine learning models work with data, and the amount of data collected by various software and hardware components all come into play. Big data combined with machine learning software allows businesses to detect and respond to intrusions in real time. In this paper we will further discuss about how Big data is used in Reinforcement Learning to enhance data security. </p>
